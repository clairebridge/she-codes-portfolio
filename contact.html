        <p> My name is Claire, and I am an aspiring Interaction Designer. In the future and as a designer, I hope to contribute positively to the evolving world around me, and explore innovation, free thinking, individuality, and sustainable development. My life experiences have shaped me as a person, and as a designer by allowing me to consider alternative ideologies and mindsets from those around me.
            “As an Interaction and IT Analyst, I will utilize my creativity to problem solve using innovation, sustainable practice, empathy and compassion, so that my design contribution is meaningful.”
            I am looking forward to working and experiencing all aspects of the information technology domain. I have experience creating infographics and web site user interfaces for a range of large-scale organizations, where at times, tasks were daunting and unfamiliar. However, through these challenges, I understand that resilience is one of the most important attributes to possess in fast paced and stressful environments. As well, I appreciate how important it is to take responsibility for my work, as it is crucial to understand the consequence that design can have on the world.
